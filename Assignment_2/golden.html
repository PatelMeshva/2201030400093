          There once was a king named Midas who did a good deed for a satyr — a
          spirit of nature. Dionysus, the god of wine, then granted him a wish.
        </p>
        <p class="there-once-was">
          For his wish, Midas asked that whatever he touched would turn to gold.
          Despite Dionysus’ efforts to prevent it, Midas pleaded that this was a
          fantastic wish, so it was bestowed.
        </p>
        <p class="there-once-was">
          Excited about his newly-earned powers, Midas started touching all
          kinds of things, turning each item into pure gold.
        </p>
        <p class="there-once-was">
          But soon, Midas became hungry. As he picked up a piece of food, he
          found he couldn’t eat it. It had turned to gold in his hand.
        </p>

        <p class="there-once-was">
          Hungry, Midas groaned, “I’ll starve! Perhaps this was not such an
          excellent wish after all!”
        </p>
        <p class="there-once-was">
          Seeing his dismay, Midas’ beloved daughter threw her arms around him
          to comfort him, and she, too, turned to gold. “The golden touch is no
          blessing,” Midas cried.
