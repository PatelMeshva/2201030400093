          One day, a fox became very hungry. He went out to search for some
          food. He searched high and low but couldn’t find anything to eat.
        </p>
        <p class="one-day-a">
          Finally, as his stomach rumbled, he stumbled upon a farmer’s wall. At
          the top of the wall, he saw the biggest, juiciest grapes he’d ever
          seen. They were a rich purple, telling the fox they were ready to be
          eaten.
        </p>
        <p class="one-day-a">
          To reach the grapes, the fox had to jump high in the air. As he
          jumped, he opened his mouth to catch the grapes, but he missed. The
          fox tried again but missed once more.
        </p>

        <p class="one-day-a">He tried a few more times but kept failing.</p>
        <p class="one-day-a">
          Finally, the fox decided to give up and go home. While he walked away,
          he muttered, “I’m sure the grapes were sour anyway.”
